# ✅ FIXED: Email Verification Issue for Test Accounts

## The Problem

After running the test data setup, you couldn't login with the test accounts because they showed:

```
❌ Please verify your email before logging in.
    Check your inbox for the verification link.
```

## The Solution

Updated the login system to **skip email verification for test accounts** with `@testcompany.com` domain.

### What Changed:

1. **Login Page** (`/app/login/page.jsx`)

   - Added test account detection
   - Test accounts (`@testcompany.com`) bypass email verification
   - Real accounts still require email verification

2. **Setup Page** (`/app/setup-test-data/page.jsx`)
   - Added info message explaining test account behavior
   - Shows blue notification about email verification bypass

### Code Changes:

```javascript
// Before:
if (!user.emailVerified) {
  // Block all unverified users
}

// After:
const isTestAccount = email.endsWith("@testcompany.com");
if (!user.emailVerified && !isTestAccount) {
  // Only block non-test unverified users
}
```

## ✅ You Can Now:

1. **Login with test accounts immediately** (no email verification needed)

   - `admin@testcompany.com` / `Test@123`
   - `john.doe@testcompany.com` / `Test@123`
   - `bob.johnson@testcompany.com` / `Test@123`
   - All other `@testcompany.com` accounts

2. **Real employees still get proper security**
   - Accounts with real company domains (e.g., `@yourcompany.com`)
   - Must verify email before first login
   - Maintains security for production use

## 🎯 Next Steps:

### Try It Now:

1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Login with: `admin@testcompany.com` / `Test@123`
3. ✅ Should work immediately!

### Test Different Scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Company Admin**

```
Email: admin@testcompany.com
Password: Test@123
→ Should redirect to /company/dashboard
```

**Scenario 2: Employee with Subscription**

```
Email: john.doe@testcompany.com
Password: Test@123
→ Should redirect to /employee/dashboard
→ Features should be unlocked
→ Can see withdrawal history
```

**Scenario 3: Employee without Subscription**

```
Email: bob.johnson@testcompany.com
Password: Test@123
→ Should redirect to /employee/dashboard
→ Features should be locked
→ Should see payment modal
```

## 🔒 Security Notes:

### For Production:

- Change the test domain check from hardcoded `@testcompany.com`
- Add environment variable for test domains
- Or remove bypass completely for production

### Example Production Fix:

```javascript
// In .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_TEST_DOMAIN = testcompany.com;

// In login page
const isTestAccount =
  process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" &&
  email.endsWith(`@${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TEST_DOMAIN}`);
```

## 📊 Summary:

| Account Type                      | Email Verification  | Can Login?         |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Test accounts (@testcompany.com)  | ❌ Not required     | ✅ Yes             |
| Real employees (@yourcompany.com) | ✅ Required         | After verification |
| Production (recommendation)       | ✅ Required for all | After verification |

- ✅ Login without email verification
- ✅ Company admin dashboard
