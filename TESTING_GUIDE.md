## Cleaning Up Test Data

To remove all test data and start fresh:

1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Firestore Database
3. Delete collections:
   - `companies`
   - `employees`
   - `withdrawals`
4. Authentication â†’ Users
5. Delete all test users
6. Re-run the setup page

## Troubleshooting

### "Email already in use" Error

- Test data already exists
- Either use existing credentials or clean up first

### "Company domain not registered" during registration

- Make sure to use `@testcompany.com` domain
- Setup page must be run first

### Email verification not working

- Check Firebase Console â†’ Authentication â†’ Templates
- Test accounts are created with `emailVerified: true`

### Features still locked after payment

- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `hasSubscription` field in Firestore

## API Testing with Postman/Thunder Client

Company Admin Token endpoint:

```
POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login
{
  "email": "admin@testcompany.com",
  "password": "Test@123"
}
```

## Firebase Rules Required

Make sure your Firestore rules allow:

- Authenticated users can read/write their own employee document
- Company admins can read/write all employees in their company
- Employees can create withdrawal requests
- Company admins can approve/reject withdrawals

## Next Steps

After setting up test data:

1. âœ… Test employee login flow
2. âœ… Test company admin panel
3. âœ… Test withdrawal requests
4. âœ… Test subscription payment
5. âœ… Test new employee registration
6. âœ… Test trust score calculations
7. âœ… Test email verification

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check Firebase Console for data
3. Verify environment variables in `.env.local`
4. Ensure Firebase config is correct

## Important Notes

- **DO NOT** use this setup in production
- Test data uses simple passwords
- Fake payment integration (Razorpay simulation)
- Email verification is auto-approved for test accounts
- Trust scores are randomly assigned (not calculated)
